## Reflections
I really struggled with this assignment. It took me a long time to get the delete functionality to work properly but I was able to get it to work after comparing to how other functionalities work in code. Deleting it from the local storage but deleting the right one from the table was tricky. I also struggled with the sorting but was eventually able to figure out a way to switch between ascending, descending, and unsorted by adding so variables to keep track of the current state. The auto complete was also hard and I was not able to complete it. I tried a few different examples I found online but none of them made the auto complete box appear.
